									<h2>About CS KickStart</h2>

									<h3>Why does CS KickStart exsist?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									The United States is in a computing crisis. The US is in a computing crisis. By 2020, there will be 1.4 million computing-related jobs, which means 1 out of every 250 people will need to work a computing job, even accounting for population growth. At current graduation rates, we’ll only be about to fill 1/3rd of those jobs. 2015 workplace reports revealed that only 18% of <a href="https://www.google.com/diversity/">Google's</a> tech employees are women, and only 16% of <a href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/06/driving-diversity-at-facebook/">Facebook's</a> tech employees are women.
								</p>
								<p>
									Without representation in CS women lose financial opportunities and a voice in shaping the future. CS jobs are high-paying, fast-growing, and stable. Additionally, computer scientists build the systems and infrastructure that end up changing the structures of society.
								</p>
								<p>
									Computer Science needs women.

								<p>
									Women need Computer Science.
								</p>
								<p>
									But that's just in industry. What about in acedemia?

								<p>
									Based on a survey from EECS 280, (the second introductory programming class at the University of Michigan) we found that female students were less likely to have prior programming experience, female students were less likely to visualize themselves in a career that used CS, and female students found the atmosphere less friendly and more competitive than male students.

									<h3>How does CS KickStart help with this?</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									We made a camp! CS KickStart was founded in 2016 and aims to help with four main problems we saw in the computer science department at the University of Michigan. Our most prominent interventions are teaching incoming freshmen to code before classes start, expose them to a wider variety of computer science careers (not just software engineering), build a support group of likeminded peers before classes start, and explicitly discuss underrepresentation in computer science.  
								</p>
								<p>
									By doing this, CS KickStart hopes to improve the enrollment and persistence of women in the University of Michigan computer science program in order to give women a voice, level the playing field in terms of academic and career opportunities, and benefit the field of computer science through the development of a talented and diverse workforce.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some comments from the students who participated in the 2016 program:
									<blockquote>"I got to meet so many interesting people, and every time I see anybody from CS Kickstart on campus, we always stop and say hi. It's nice to have so many familiar friendly faces around campus already."</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I am really glad I did the program and am very grateful for the opportunity to get to do it. I would NOT be taking EECS 183 right now if I hadn't done CS KickStart.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“Great program, I really enjoyed it and am seriously considering majoring in computer science. Also I met a lot of awesome people with whom I am still friends with.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I had an amazing time and I'm so glad I had this opportunity. Thank you so much!”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I loved this program so much! Thank you!”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I had such a great time and learned so much during this program. Thank you!”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I can't wait to help organize CS KickStart next year!”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“Thank you for everything! I have nothing put positive things to say about this program. You are all amazing, and I'd love to be a part of it next year.”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“The program was an amazing experience that I will forever cherish and thank you for allowing me to be a part of it! :)”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“Great job and I really enjoyed this!”</blockquote>

									<blockquote>“I'm really grateful for the chance to participate in this week-long program!”</blockquote>
